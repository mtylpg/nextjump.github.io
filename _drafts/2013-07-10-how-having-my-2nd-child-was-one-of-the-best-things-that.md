Not what I expected, as I timidly told our CEO that I was expecting #2. How could I keep the same pace. How was I going to not only keep my post but add value to the business while being a good Mom and taking care of my kids.
What I heard…we will make this work. To which I thanked our CEO, but how were we going to make this work when it’s not supposed to work. I’m expected to fail. Why less than 10% of corner offices are held by women, is because they leave to take care of their children and can’t find the “balance” to do both well. So why would this be any different.

Well we are both parents and what wasn’t working for me, wasn’t working for him either. Days of packed calendars reviewing everything in the business to then get to our work at night wasn’t sustainable.

How could we make it work for the business and at home. We needed more leaders, employees who can think for themselves, make the right judgment call, and take ownership of revenue and culture initiatives. We needed more people to own more things so we wouldn’t have to do it all. 
A sustainable system where everyone contributes to the bottom line and to culture. A year later…its working for the business and for this working mom, and working dad. Forget surviving, we are thriving both at work and at home.
